# added tags:
- '##' subtitle
- '###' intertextual elements (to be removed for scansion)
- '# <no title>' -- for texts w/o titles

# notes
- Do not keep the books structure? (e.g. parts as I, II, III, etc.)
- old orthography uses ö instead of õ ? (e.g. A_591)

# questions
- how to keep quotation marks (in the 19th-c sources a quote opens every line, in modern - only around the actual direct speech)
- agreement on what is a single poem (e.g. if there is a poem entitled "Two elegies", are we counting them as two different texts, or one? same about numerated epigrams, jokes, etc.)
