# questions
- how to keep quotation marks (in the 19th-c sources a quote opens every line, in modern - only around the actual direct speech)
- agreement on what is a single poem (e.g. if there is a poem entitled "Two elegies", are we counting them as two different texts, or one? same about numerated epigrams, jokes, etc.)
